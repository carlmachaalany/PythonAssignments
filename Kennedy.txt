we observe today not a victory
 of party
but a celebration 
of freedom symbolizing
and end as well as a beginning
 signifying
renewal as well as change

as we express our gratitude we must
never forget that the highest appreciation
is not to utter words but to live by them
change is the law of life and those who look
only to the past or present are certain to
miss the future
let every nation know whether it wishes us
well or ill that we shall pay any price bear
any burden meet any hardship support any friend
oppose any foe to assure the survival and
the success of liberty
when power leads man towards arrogance
poetry reminds him of his limitations
when power narrows the area of the concern of man
poetry reminds him of the richness and
diversity of existence and when power corrupts
poetry cleanses
